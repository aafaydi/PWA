Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Budget Tracker

# Disciption:
 My task is update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once you’ve made these changes, you’ll deploy the application to Heroku.

# Application Functionalities
The ability to enter deposits offline.
The ability to enter expenses offline.
Offline entries should be added to the tracker when the application is brought back online
